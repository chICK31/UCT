<p>As you can tell by the function stack of Society, Society is inherently extraverted, the proof is as follows:</p>
    <p><b> The Hero function of Society:</b> is the “Control Types” (ENFJs, ENTJs, ESTPs, ESTJs).</p>
    <p><b> The Parent function of Society:</b> is the “Finisher types” (INTJs, INFJs, ISTPs, ISTJs)</p>
    <p><b> The Child function of Society:</b> is the “Starter types” (ENTPs, ENFPs, ESFPs, ESFJs).</p>
    <p><b> The Inferior function of Society:</b>  is the “Background types” (INTPs, INFPs, ISFJs, ISFPs) </p>
    <p><b> The Nemesis Function of Society:</b>   is the actual entity/thing/group of people that challenges the Hero function of Society (“Control Types”) to sharpen it.</p>

    <p><b> The Critic Function of Society:</b>  is the actual entity/thing/group of people that challenges the Parent function of Society. So, in this case, it would be anything that challenges “Finisher Types.” Technically, the Critic could swap with the child if society was UD | UF, but that’s a story for another time.
    </p>
    <p><b> The Trickster Function of Society:</b>  is the “things that Nobody is aware of within the context of Society.” Difficult or impossible to detect or remember. It could also be something hidden in plain sight, but that society is unaware of.
    </p>
    <p><b> The Demon Function of Society:</b> is the Entity that protects the inferior function of Society (Background Types) from threats when the Parent Function of Society (“Finisher Types”) can’t. Technically, it could turn into an angel function and could manifest itself in angelic revelations, not to be confused with the divine attitude of the child function.    </p>
<p>The Hero function of Society is “Control Types” because they usually are the ones in charge of managing everything in Society. They are the bringers of order much like a Hero, and if they fail, it’s up to the parent function or inferior function to pick up the slack.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The Parent function of Society is “Finisher types” because they are responsible caretakers of Society, for instance, INTJs would literally save the world if it were in danger, INFJs like to manage and counsel people to be better (like a good parent function), ISTPs want to teach others what they know about mechanical things, and ISTJs have encyclopedic knowledge used to parent other people into shape (like ESTPs for example).
</p>
<p>The Child functions of Society are “Starter types”  because they are the optimistic function. So they tend to be less responsible with what they do which is why they start things but never finish them (finishing is more for the parent function). The optimism of starter types makes them the child function of humanity.
</p>
<p>The Inferior function of society (“Background types”) want to become the new Hero Function of Society (INFPs want power which is indicative of control types, INTPs want to create a “master system” which is an aspiration to become a control type, ISFPs aspire to become ENTJs which are control types, and ISFJs want to be super controlling with their NI demon or TI child even if they aren’t conscious of it). All to say that Background types want to become Control Types much like how the inferior function wants to aspire to become the hero function. </p>
<p>Questions and answer</p>
<p>Q: Why is this important?</p>
<p>A: I’m just making observations about the present metaphysical construction of society through my Ne parent. Take it if you want, or don’t. Your choice.</p>
