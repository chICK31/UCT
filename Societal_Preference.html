<p>This article has the following assumptions which may or may not be true:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>NJ societies, like Japan,</b> are Less psychologically prejudiced against NPs 
<li><b>NJ societies, like Japan,</b> are More psychologically prejudiced against SPs 
<li><b>SJ societies, like the United States,</b> are Less psychologically prejudiced against SPs 
<li><b>SJ societies, like the United States,</b> are More psychologically prejudiced against NPs 
<li><b>SP societies, like Mexico,</b> are Less psychologically prejudiced against SJs
<li><b>SP societies, like Mexico,</b> are More psychologically prejudiced against NJs
<li><b>NP societies, like China,</b> are Less psychologically prejudiced against NJs
<li><b>NP societies, like China,</b> are More psychologically prejudiced against SJs

<p>I think it’s best to look at it from a Natural pair perspective. Because SJs are the natural pair for NJs, it makes it easy for NJs to live in SJ society and vice versa for SJs living in NJ society. One example of how this works is how Japan, an NJ society, is rich in tradition, which means that SJs would be able to acclimate to that environment better than any other type. And, NJs in SJ society, are enabled in SJ society by being encouraged by the SJs to perform. For instance, ENTJs could successfully start a new business, INTJs could perform in music concerts, INFJs could counsel people, and ENFJs could be a part of the education system. All within an SJ society.</p>

<p>Whereas SPs in an SJ are much like the golden pair relationship, there are challenges and enablement and vice versa for an SJ living in an SP society. In Mexico, an SP society, SJs are usually enabled and disabled depending on the specific context, but that manifests in “high highs' ' and “low lows' ' because of the oscillation between feeling wanted and useful or feeling outcast and useless. SJ to SJ society tends to be more stable as exemplified by SJ popular culture. Another example is the Mexican cartel, a fairly SP phenomena since it's an anarchy-oriented way of life. South Africa is another example of an SP society, so people often live in the moment there, whereas in Japan, an NJ society, that isn’t as much the case. (We’ll dive deeper into this in part 2 of this article; specifically how and why societies are different).
</i></p>

<p>Since the society has an understanding of its temperament, it’s able to build a society around its type, so, for SJ society, it builds the society around SJs, but it’s not technically enabling, instead, it’s merely stabilizing for the SJs in SJ society, or NJs for NJ society, etc.</p> 

<p>But for the subconscious relationship such as NPs living in SJ society (like, NPs living in the United States), it’s complete Hell. For SJs living in NP society (like, SJs living in China), it’s also complete Hell because China is a country where they’d like to have more engineers, and SJs, don’t particularly want to become engineers, whereas NPs in SJ society, SJs are trying to push religion, the affiliative school system, and boring repetitive things that aren’t conducive to how NPs get their cognitive origin. (This is one example and we’ll discuss all examples in part 2 of this article)</p>

<p>This pattern could be replicated to yield the answer to all of our problems: </p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to be enabled then you should move to the society of your natural pair (NJ to SJ, SJ to NJ, NP to SP, and SP to NP). </li>
<li>If you want high highs and low lows like the golden pair, then you should move to the society of your shadow (NP to NJ, NJ to NP, SJ to SP, and SP to SJ). </li>
<li>If you want something stable, you should move to the society of your ego (NJ to NJ, NP to NP, SJ to SJ, SP to SP). </li>
<li>If you want to be disabled, then you should move to a society of your subconscious (NJ to SP, SP to NJ, NP to SJ, and  SJ to NP,).</li>
</ol>
