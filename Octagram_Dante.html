<p>
    According to Dante Alighieri, the author the wrote Dante's Inferno, Dante’s Purgatorio, and Dante’s Paradiso, there are 4 stages of the afterlife, and from Top to Bottom, it goes like this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Heaven (Joy): SD | SF</li>
    <li>Purgatory (Decay): SD | UF</li>
    <li>Upper Hell (Hope): UD | SF</li>
    <li>Lower Hell (Despair): UD | UF</li>
    </ol>
<h2>
    Lower Hell (Despair): UD | UF
</h2>
<p>
    This is where the essence of the devil himself lives. All the worst sinners get sent there after death. The reason why this represents the Octagram of UD | UF is because all the people down there want death, destruction, doom, chaos, pandemonium, and more. 
    This...isn't good, and the reason why they're there is because they've committed great atrocities like murder, coveting one's wife, or generally breaking one of the 10 commandments. I wouldn't recommend this. It's important to note that you don't need to be religious to break the 10 commandments.
	Often, people who are at the bottom of hell, don’t regret it…but they suffer tremendously…they often want more death and suffering based on a whim…Such is the UD | UF lifestyle.
    They...don't want hope. They need to pretend to seek hope in order to get it. It's counter intuitive...Also, in Dante's inferno, the people of hell (UD: unconscious developed), encounter many demons in their attempt to ascend, but as the sign says at the entrance of hell "Abandon all hope to all who enter." Which means
    that it's hopeless and escape from UD (unconscious developed) is hopeless...
</p>
<h2>
    Upper Hell (Hope): UD | SF
</h2>
<p>
    The people in upper Hell (UD | SF) don’t suffer as much as the people who are literally being tortured alive in lower
     hell (UD | UF). The way it’s portrayed in Dante’s Inferno is pretty chill, it’s like this group of philosophers who are forever apart from the light of
      being SD (subconsciously developed). It’s not that bad compared to how bad things could get, but it’s certainly not as good as things could get when 
      compared to the heavenliness  of SD | SF Joy energy. This is because it’s impossible for UD individuals to “see the light” which is to say, escape hell. 
      I mean, hell is still hell, but it’s not that bad. Usually, people there are just grateful that they’re not UD | UF like some of the other people, but 
      their potential is dictated in a different constitution to SD…They generally have less potential than SD individuals to enjoy life. Usually, UD | SF individuals 
      like to intellectually spar with each other to strengthen each other, but for 
    UD | SF individuals, there exist no such heaven. They are doomed to the mindset that heaven doesn’t exist, or if it does, "I won’t go there because I don’t belong there."
    or, in their attempts to become SD (subconscious developed) they will fail...and they shall fall.
</p>
<h2>
    Purgatory (Decay): SD | UF
</h2>
<p>
    Purgatory is strange…it lingers on the idea of redemption from fallen grace or broken divinity. It’s like a samurai dishonoring their family or akin to an 
    unfortunate betrayal of life without <i>proper</i> reconciliation…Some  people say that decay energy is like fruit that has spoiled but was once ripe…Usually, in a fictional story displaying a 
    SD | UF type, it takes an extremely strong external force to bring them back to SF (subconscious focus) such as strong masculine leadership of some kind. 
    In Dante’s Purgatorio, the people in purgatory are portrayed as lifting heavy rocks to get rid of their pride and to ascend up the mountain leading to heaven. 
    All the floors in the mountain of ascension  that is purgatory involve getting over a deadly sin. For instance, for the floor of Gluttony, the people there must 
    resist the temptation of getting succulent, juicy, tasty, aromatic, ripe fruit from a tree, doing so would be rewarded by making you eligible to reach the next floor.
     Absolute trust is necessary to overcome the floors, and, at the top…there lies the “Garden of Eden.”
</p>
<p>
    The “Garden of Eden” represents the fruit of overcoming the trials of purgatory…one could say that “it’s not free to enter heaven.”  
    This is basically the congratulations for overcoming SD | UF (decay energy) as an archetype and successfully transitioning into SD | SF Joy energy! 
        Congratulations…Most people in that garden are people you love and who love you back. This is the true essence of heaven, a true reason for living!
</p>
<h2>
    Heaven (Joy): SD | SF
</h2>
<p>
The fundamental principle of Heaven, or SD | SF Joy energy is that they are constituted in such a way where their subconscious is 
capable of existing in a place where it’s suitable to grow, much like a garden…UD types would have a particularly hard time understanding 
due to the nature of how being in Hell, or UD, affects their combative interpretive systems, but for the sake of accuracy, I’m going to have to ignore that. 
In heaven, or SD | SF, it’s the divine child function and the royal and heroic inferior function that takes charge and manages everything. 
That’s why everything is so at peace. It’s not necessarily peace, but the aggression circuits in the brain are more sexually proper…How do I explain this…it’s 
like the interpretive systems of the brain have coagulated into a coalescence of particularly pretentious, obnoxious, and audacious holiness, 
that UD types are naturally  opposed to discussing unless  they're  particularly lucky. 
In heaven, or SD, the child function takes a more parent/teacher role for themselves and others, but that doesn't 
mean that the parent function becomes more like a child. In fact, quite the opposite, the parent function becomes more like a grandparent function, 
and the hero function becomes more heroic due to the guidance of the inferior. It’s like the hero function becomes the inferior function’s sidekick 
and the inferior becomes the leader. Technically speaking, the inferior function in SD | SF Joy energy is…unstoppable. This is because, if the 
inferior function is stopped or disabled, then the SD | SF Joy energy could become SD  | UF decay energy due to improper training. Generally s
peaking, SD | SF types try tirelessly to stay SF and they avoid becoming UF like the plague, that’s why, when transitioning from SF to UF, it’s 
particularly painful. When the inferior fails, all hope is lost, and they go to purgatory (SD | UF) to retrain themselves to be fit of the 
kingdom of heaven (SD | SF). The more training in purgatory that a SD | UF has, the better they become at navigating their way into heaven and how. 
Though, there is usually a time penalty and a seemingly immovable obstacle between them (SD | UF) and heaven (SD | SF), but it's not like it's impossible to become SF,
 it just takes time, energy, true relationships, proper guidance, and some luck.
